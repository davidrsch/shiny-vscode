## 0.0.4

- The default value for `shiny.python.port` is now `0`, which means "choose an unused port at runtime". This is convenient for running multiple apps simultaneously on the same machine. For convenience, the extension remembers each VS Code Workspace's most recent random port, and tries to use it if available.

## 0.0.3

- Initial release
